About the assignment:
-- 
Create a class called Board that represent the game tic-tac-toe.  
The class is built by inputing it the board's size N * N.  
Every square has to have only: '.' \ 'X' \ 'O' - the dot char represents an empty square.  
The class has to support the operators: output, =, [].  
The class has to deal with exceptions: 
inputing an illegal char or trying to exceed the board's limits throws an exception according to the case.  
    
**File list:** (In development)
